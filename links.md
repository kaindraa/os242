### [Regular Expressions in Python (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-regular-expressions/)
This article covers how to use regular expressions in Python to search and manipulate strings. It is interesting because regular expressions are crucial for text processing in various system scripts.

### [Shell Scripting Crash Course (freeCodeCamp)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/shell-scripting-crash-course-how-to-write-bash-scripts-in-linux/)
This tutorial introduces shell scripting basics, including essential commands and syntax for Linux systems. It is interesting because shell scripting helps automate tasks and manage system operations effectively.

### [Basic Principles of Cybersecurity (Medium)](https://medium.com/@a.turing/basic-principles-of-cybersecurity-c70cc238e709)
This article explains fundamental cybersecurity principles such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It is interesting because it provides a good foundation for understanding cybersecurity in operating systems.

### [Linux Directory Structure (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-directory-structure/)
This article explains the Linux directory structure, including essential directories such as `/bin`, `/home`, `/var`, and more. It is interesting because understanding the directory structure is crucial for system administration tasks.

### [GPG vs. SSH Key](https://locall.host/gpg-vs-ssh-key/)
This website was very insightful in highlighting the differences between GPG and SSH keys. Although both are powerful tools, they have distinct purposes. If you need secure authentication for remote servers, SSH keys are the best choice. However, GPG keys are more suitable when you need to encrypt or sign emails and files.

### [Linux Directory Structure in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42iQKuQodW4)
This video effectively summarized the most common Linux directories in just 100 seconds. It helped me realize that the Linux directory layout isnâ€™t too different from the Windows structure. I now have a much clearer understanding of how the directory system works in my virtual machine for this Operating Systems course.


### [Virtual Memory Explained (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)
This article explains the concept of virtual memory in operating systems, detailing how it works, its types (paging and segmentation), and how virtual memory is managed. It is interesting because virtual memory plays a critical role in enabling systems to handle large applications efficiently by using both RAM and disk space.

### [C Structs Explained (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKXP1HZ8xIs)
This YouTube video gives a thorough explanation of `structs` in C programming. It breaks down the concept of structures, how they group multiple data types, and how they are used in C programs. It is interesting because understanding `structs` is crucial for writing efficient C code, especially in systems programming.

### [Dynamic Memory Allocation in C (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/)
This article on GeeksforGeeks thoroughly explains dynamic memory allocation in C using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, `free`, and `realloc`. It covers how arrays in C are fixed in size, which can be limiting, and how dynamic memory allocation addresses this by allowing memory sizes to change at runtime. This process is essential for flexible memory management, especially in situations where data size might grow or shrink, and is foundational for efficient data structure implementations in C.
