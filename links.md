## Helpful Links for Operating Systems Course

### [Regular Expressions in Python (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-regular-expressions/)
This article covers how to use regular expressions in Python to search and manipulate strings. It is interesting because regular expressions are crucial for text processing in various system scripts.

### [Shell Scripting Crash Course (freeCodeCamp)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/shell-scripting-crash-course-how-to-write-bash-scripts-in-linux/)
This tutorial introduces shell scripting basics, including essential commands and syntax for Linux systems. It is interesting because shell scripting helps automate tasks and manage system operations effectively.

### [Basic Principles of Cybersecurity (Medium)](https://medium.com/@a.turing/basic-principles-of-cybersecurity-c70cc238e709)
This article explains fundamental cybersecurity principles such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It is interesting because it provides a good foundation for understanding cybersecurity in operating systems.

### [Linux Directory Structure (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-directory-structure/)
This article explains the Linux directory structure, including essential directories such as `/bin`, `/home`, `/var`, and more. It is interesting because understanding the directory structure is crucial for system administration tasks.

### [GPG vs. SSH Key](https://locall.host/gpg-vs-ssh-key/)
This website was very insightful in highlighting the differences between GPG and SSH keys. Although both are powerful tools, they have distinct purposes. If you need secure authentication for remote servers, SSH keys are the best choice. However, GPG keys are more suitable when you need to encrypt or sign emails and files.

### [Linux Directory Structure in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42iQKuQodW4)
This video effectively summarized the most common Linux directories in just 100 seconds. It helped me realize that the Linux directory layout isn’t too different from the Windows structure. I now have a much clearer understanding of how the directory system works in my virtual machine for this Operating Systems course.


### [Virtual Memory Explained (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)
This article explains the concept of virtual memory in operating systems, detailing how it works, its types (paging and segmentation), and how virtual memory is managed. It is interesting because virtual memory plays a critical role in enabling systems to handle large applications efficiently by using both RAM and disk space.

### [C Structs Explained (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKXP1HZ8xIs)
This YouTube video gives a thorough explanation of `structs` in C programming. It breaks down the concept of structures, how they group multiple data types, and how they are used in C programs. It is interesting because understanding `structs` is crucial for writing efficient C code, especially in systems programming.

### [Dynamic Memory Allocation in C (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/)
This article on GeeksforGeeks thoroughly explains dynamic memory allocation in C using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, `free`, and `realloc`. It covers how arrays in C are fixed in size, which can be limiting, and how dynamic memory allocation addresses this by allowing memory sizes to change at runtime. This process is essential for flexible memory management, especially in situations where data size might grow or shrink, and is foundational for efficient data structure implementations in C.

### [What is MD5? (TechTarget)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/MD5)  
This article from TechTarget explains the MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5) hashing algorithm, a one-way cryptographic function designed for data integrity and message authentication. Originally intended for secure digital signatures, MD5 is now deprecated for cryptographic use due to its vulnerability to collisions. However, it is still commonly used as a non-cryptographic checksum to verify data integrity.

### [What is GCC? (Incredibuild)](https://www.incredibuild.com/integrations/gcc)
This article from Incredibuild provides an overview of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), a robust set of compilers supporting languages like C, C++, and Fortran, commonly used across Linux, Windows, and other operating systems. Created by the Free Software Foundation, GCC is essential for transforming source code into executable binaries by following the UNIX philosophy of modular tool usage. It’s readily available for installation on major platforms and includes powerful features for code optimization, cross-platform compilation, and multi-language support.

### [What is a Cross-Compiler and Its Applications (Medium)](https://medium.com/@harsh.bihani20/cross-compiler-and-its-applications-37b6b7c76d36)  
This article explores cross-compilers, tools for compiling code on one system for another platform. Widely used in modern software development, they support tasks like embedded systems, game development, and cross-platform apps. The article explains how cross-compilers work and highlights their benefits, such as portability, time-saving, and cost-effectiveness, making them essential for versatile software creation.

### [GCC Linux (Javatpoint)](https://www.javatpoint.com/gcc-linux)  
This article explains GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) as a powerful and versatile compiler system widely used on Linux for programming in languages like C, C++, and Fortran. As a core part of the GNU toolchain, GCC transforms source code into executable files through preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking. The article highlights its history, from its 1987 release for C programming to its adoption as the standard Linux compiler, and explores its components like GNU Make and GDB. It also provides guidance on installation, usage, and practical GCC command examples for developers of all levels.
